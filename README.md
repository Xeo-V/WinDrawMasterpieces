## Introduction 🌟
Are you intrigued by the Windows API but find it to be like forbidden knowledge? You're not alone! There are surprisingly few tutorials out there on using the Windows API for various tasks. This repository aims to break that barrier by providing examples of how to create a window and draw using the Windows API.

## Project Description 📝
This repository contains two distinct C++ examples that demonstrate the use of the Windows API for drawing:
- `drawByWindowCreation.cpp`: A basic example that opens a window and allows for drawing within it.
- `drawOffScreen.cpp`: An advanced example that demonstrates off-screen drawing in an always-on-top transparent window.

## Tech Stack 🛠️
- C++
- Windows API

## Setup ⚙️
### Prerequisites
- Windows OS
- C++ Compiler (e.g., GCC, MSVC)

### Steps
1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the repository's root directory.
3. Compile the desired C++ file.
```
g++ drawByWindowCreation.cpp -o drawByWindowCreation.exe
g++ drawOffScreen.cpp -o drawOffScreen.exe
```

## Usage 🛠️
### Basic Example: Window Creation 🖼️
Run `drawByWindowCreation.exe` to execute the basic example. A window will pop up where you can see the drawing.

### Advanced Example: Off-Screen Drawing 🌈
Run `drawOffScreen.exe` to execute the advanced example. This will create an always-on-top transparent window that allows you to draw off-screen.

## Images 📸
Both the basic and advanced examples come with images to showcase what each example is capable of. These images are stored in the repository and are named `drawByWIndowCreation.png` and `drawoffscreeen.png` respectively.
